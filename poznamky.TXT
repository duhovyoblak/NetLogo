;; TURTLE STRATEGY #2:
;; Check neighboring patches to see if any are empty.  If any are
;; empty, pick a random empty one and move onto its center.
;; Note that we can't just do "fd 1", since the patch's center
;; might be more than 1 unit away from our current position.

Turtle Command Patch Command

"self" and "myself" are very different. "self" is simple; it means "me". "myself" means "the turtle or patch who asked me to do what I'm doing right now."

When an agent has been asked to run some code, using myself in that code reports the agent (turtle or patch) that did the asking.

myself is most often used in conjunction with of to read or set variables in the asking agent.

myself can be used within blocks of code not just in the ask command, but also hatch, sprout, of, with, all?, with-min, with-max, min-one-of, max-one-of, min-n-of, max-n-of.

ask turtles
  [ ask patches in-radius 3
      [ set pcolor [color] of myself ] ]
;; each turtle makes a colored "splotch" around itself

See the "Myself Example" code example for more examples.
